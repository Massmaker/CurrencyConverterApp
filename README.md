# CurrencyConverterApp

This is a small 1-screen iOS application using a single API endpoint to convert currency values.

User is able to select from several currencies and enter an amount.
The exchange rate with the converted amount is queried automatically after currency change or after the input amount change.
Also it is refreshed once per 10 seconds using the same API call.

No third party libraries were used. The UI is really dull, the accent was made better on data/models workflow.
